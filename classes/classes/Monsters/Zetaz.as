If the dramatic change in appearance is any indication, he's had to toughen up nearly as much as yourself over the past "+(mainClassPtr.model.time.days < 60? "weeks":"months")+".  Zetaz still wears the trademark imp loincloth, though it bulges and shifts with his movements in a way that suggest a considerable flaccid size and large, full sack.  His shoulders are wrapped with studded leather and his wrists are covered with metallic bracers.  The imp has clearly invested in at least a little additional protection.  It does not look like he carries a weapon.");
